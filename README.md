# Technitos

A repository dedicated to managing my service bots for the various platforms I use. Currently, both my [Reddit](https://github.com/Frontear/Technitos/tree/reddit) bot and [Discord](https://github.com/Frontear/Technitos/tree/discord) are developed here.

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository via `git clone https://github.com/Frontear/Technitos.git Technitos`
- Follow the instructions in the other branches for continued setup.

Please do **not** push to the master branch. The master branch is intentionally left empty so that future bots may use it to have a fresh environment to work with. Only push/pull request to the dedicated branches which house specific bot code.
